# 🎯 ClientFinder: Local Business Intelligence Tool

## 🚀 Overview

A sophisticated market research tool designed to identify local businesses with digital optimization opportunities. 

This automated intelligence agent analyzes local business listings to detect those lacking an active web presence. It goes beyond simple listing checks by performing a multi-stage verification process to ensure high-quality, actionable results for web development agencies and digital consultants.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🔍 Smart Discovery Engine**: Systematically maps local service providers (e.g., "Dentists", "Legal Firms") in any target geography.
*   **🛡️ Human-Like Interaction**: Leveraging `undetected-chromedriver` to navigate complex DOM structures while maintaining a low profile, simulating authentic user behavior.
*   **🧠 Multi-Stage Verification**:
    *   **Primary Filter**: Analyzes map listings for missing direct website links.
    *   **Secondary Intelligence**: autonomously initiates a background audit using search engine queries to verify if a business truly lacks a website or if it's just unlinked, effectively filtering out 90% of false positives.
*   **📊 Structured Data Output**: Automatically aggregates validated opportunities into a clean CSV format for CRM integration.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Python**: Core logic and orchestration.
*   **Selenium**: Browser automation and DOM interaction.
*   **Undetected-Chromedriver**: Advanced anti-bot detection evasion.
